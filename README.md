# Game-Hangman
Programming exercise for learning FreeBasic. Each version update will include additional features as I discover more about the language.

v1.0 - December 29 2017
Very basic game exploring the use of arrays, labels, text drawings, etc. The dictionary consists of only five words, so don't expect a stimulating experience.
